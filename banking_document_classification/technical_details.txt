Banking Document Classification Using DistilBERT (Deep Learning)

Overview:

The solution classifies banking documents into categories: Loan Approval, Dispute Form, and Account Management using a transformer-based model (DistilBERT).

Technical Workflow:
-------------------------

1. Data Collection & Preparation:

Synthetic datasets generated to represent banking documents.

Data cleaning: Text normalization, removal of special characters, lowercase conversion.

2. Tokenization & Encoding:

Utilizes HuggingFace's DistilBertTokenizerFast to convert text into tokenized inputs compatible with transformer models.

3. Model Selection (DistilBERT):

Transformer-based model (distilbert-base-uncased) selected for its lightweight, fast inference, and high accuracy on NLP tasks.

4. Model Training & Evaluation:

Implemented using TensorFlow and HuggingFace Transformers.

Trained for multiple epochs, validated on test data.

5. Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Accuracy computed using sklearn.

6. Deployment & Inference:

Model and tokenizer serialized and stored.

Inference script for processing new data efficiently.

7. Technological Stack:

Programming Language: Python 3.11

Libraries: TensorFlow, Transformers (DistilBERT), Pandas, scikit-learn

8. Deployment: Local/Cloud (exportable TensorFlow model)

9. Performance Evaluation:
